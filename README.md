# Numark Mixstream Pro Mapping

This is a mapping for the [Numark Mixstream Pro](https://www.numark.com/product/mixstream-pro) for Mixxx. Wherever possible I have defaulted to Engine OS behaviour outlined in the user manual. When that was not possible I have used Mixxx default behaviour to model certain functions. This is a collaborative effort with @audministrator who created the first versions of it in [this thread](https://mixxx.discourse.group/t/numark-mixstream-pro-mapping/24858).

## Issues
- [x] Cue doesnt work when song is playing
- [ ] Hotcue behaviour doesnt match mixxx
- [x] Effect buttons wont engage effect until effect toggle is reset
- [ ] AutoLoop/Roll doesnt work when song is paused
- [ ] Jog wheels are too sensitive
- [ ] Jog wheels dont have seperate controls for top and side
- [ ] Shift pitch bend doesnt increase range
