# Numark Mixstream Pro Mapping

This is a mapping for the [Numark Mixstream Pro](https://www.numark.com/product/mixstream-pro) for Mixxx. Wherever possible I have defaulted to Engine OS behaviour outlined in the user manual. When that was not possible I have used Mixxx default behaviour to model certain functions. This is a collaborative effort with @audministrator who created the first versions of it in [this thread](https://mixxx.discourse.group/t/numark-mixstream-pro-mapping/24858).

## Issues
- [ ] Autoloop/Roll should only engage when performance pad is touched
- [ ] Autoloop should continue from the same origin beat when changed
- [ ] Implement saved loops
- [ ] Implement sampler mode
- [ ] Jog wheels are too sensitive
- [ ] Shift pitch bend doesnt increase range (if Mixxx supports this)
- [ ] Implement stems mode (when Mixxx supports this)
